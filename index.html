          <p>The whole idea of Konnectify started when I first used the famous Connectify-me. I had to first go through a dozen installers to find the cracked one for installing pro version as i found the trial version useless due to the 30 minutes time limit. Even after i succesfully installed the pro version, i felt that the application had many features that i found useless for daily use. Overall it appeared to me as a very heavy application that does something that even a batch script or a simple command line code could do. The organisation took advantage of the fact that people don't want to enter some random codes on their command prompt. Rather they would like to pay for something that could be done easily by numerous alternatives. So i decided to make a small and ultra lightweight hotspot creator that my friends could use on their windows laptops without any pains. This led to me making a small C# project under the name Konnectify and i started learning some basic C# structure. [To be continued...]</p>
